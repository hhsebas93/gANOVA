# gANOVA

This package provide a modification of the lmer() function from the lme4 package in order to optains covariance structure with equal variance for all the contrasts of factors. Using the formula + (1|id:f) with the gANOVA() function estimates only one variance for all the orthogonal contrasts of f. In addition, the formula + (1|id|f*g) is a simplification of the notation + (1|id) + (1|id:f) + (1|id:g) + (1|id:f:g) and provides a easy notation of complexe formula. Moreover, the anova() and summary() function from the lmerTest are compatible and the Kenward-Roger and Satterwhaite p-values may be computed from a lmerModgANOVA object.
